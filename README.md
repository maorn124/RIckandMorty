This is my fourh project for 5340 where we created a our own app for using an public or private API. I chose to use the Rick and Morty API for the locations. ( I have updated this app to also include the Firebase Authentication)
After implementing the API I put all the locations in a list format and then you can click on each location and it will give you details about it.
There are not many details about the location provided but I did the best with the information I had in the API.
There is now a Sign In/Sign Up page that you have to go through before entering the app that I created in the last module.
When you enter you have all the information and then in the top right you have a logout button to go back to the Sign In screen.
I have also included the Firebase photo of the authentication that it went through.
The final product is below:
