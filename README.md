This is my third project for 5340 where we created a our own app for using an public or private API. I chose to use the Rick and Morty API for the locations. 
After implementing the API I put all the locations in a list format and then you can click on each location and it will give you details about it.
There are not many details about the location provided but I did the best with the information I had in the API. The final product is below:
